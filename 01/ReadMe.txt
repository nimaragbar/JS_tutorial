3- Where does JavaScript code run ?
    originally design to run in only browsers
    so every web browsers has what we call JavaScript Engine
    that can execute JavaScript code
    for example JavaScript engine in:
        FireFox:    SpiderMonkey
        Chrome:     v8

    In 2009, toke the open source of JavaScript engine in chrome and embedded it inside C++ program, we called that program: Node
    so  Node is C++ program that include v8 JavaScript engine
    now we can run JavaScript code out side of browser so we can pass our code through Node for execution
    This means with JavaScript we can build backend for our web our mobile applications

    JavaScript can be inside our browser or Node
    browser and Node provide a run time environment for our JavaScript code

4- What is the different between JavaScript and ECMAScript:
ECMAScript is a specification and JavaScript is a programming language confirmed to this specification
so we have those organisation called ECMA which is responsible for defining standards

first version of ECMA released in 1997
now in 2015 we have ES2015/ES6
