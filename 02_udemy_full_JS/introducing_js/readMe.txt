JavaScript is a small, lightweight, object-oriented scripting language that connects to objects on host environments and provides programmatic control over them. Unlike Java, which runs on a system of classes, JavaScript supports small data types representing numeric, string, and true/false values.

HTML, “HyperText Markup Language”, comprises the blocks of webpages. Hypertext refers to the links that allow you to navigate other websites. Markup refers to the language of paired tags to specify HTML elements.

The Document Object Model (DOM) gives full access from JavaScript to dynamically create HTML with specific methods that modify the object representations of HTML elements.
